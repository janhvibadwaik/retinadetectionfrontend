    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Diabetic retinopathy, a major cause of vision loss in diabetic patients, often goes undetected in its early stages. Traditional screening methods are manual, time-consuming, and inaccessible in many areas.</p>
    <p>The challenge is to develop an automated, accurate system using retina scanning for early detection, ensuring timely diagnosis and treatment. With our innovative technology, we aim to make retina screenings accessible and efficient, helping to prevent vision loss through early intervention.</p>
